#Terminology

- [Higher-Order Functions](https://github.com/eskinner31/theInterviewNotes/blob/master/terminology/HighOrderFunctions/highOrderFunc.js) - Functions that operate on other functions. Either by taking them as arguments or by returning them. Allowing functions to operate on other functions allows for a greater degree of abstraction. Making our code clearer and less prone to bugs
