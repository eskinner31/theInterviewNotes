This repository is set up as a space to record the different challenges I've encountered through my interview process as a developer. It is meant to serve as a launchpad of learning. In the different folders you will find documentation of the different concepts/patterns/terminology/algorithms that I have encountered inside and out of the interview process, along with solutions and resources to better help in improving your understanding.
